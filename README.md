Received: Wednesday, 8:54 AM

Summary:
This email pretends to be from Microsoft, warning about a suspicious sign-in from Lagos, Nigeria. It asks you to click a button to “review recent activity” and provides a fake support number and reference ID.

Why It’s Fake:

Comes from a sketchy Outlook address, not Microsoft.

Uses scare tactics to rush you.

Poor grammar and weird wording.

Includes a fake phone number.

Generic greeting, no personal info.

The link is likely dangerous.

What to Do:

Don’t click any links or buttons.

Don’t call the number.

Report it as phishing or spam.

If you clicked, change your passwords and run a virus scan.
