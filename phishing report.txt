Phishing Email Report

Subject: Windows Error Report – Unusual sign-in activity
Sender Email Address: microsoft_team_mcpv_msteam2@outlook.com
Date Received: Wednesday, 8:54 AM

1. Summary of the Email Content
This email pretends to be a warning from Microsoft, claiming there was suspicious sign-in activity on your account. It mentions a foreign IP address from Lagos, Nigeria, supposedly trying to access your system. The message urges you to click on a “Review recent activity” button to investigate the issue. It also includes a fake reference number and a phone number for supposed support, all wrapped in what looks like an official Microsoft message.

2. Signs That This Is a Phishing Email
There are several red flags that suggest this message is a phishing attempt:

Suspicious Email Address: The message comes from an Outlook.com email, which is not an official Microsoft domain. A real security alert from Microsoft would come from a legitimate domain like @microsoft.com.

Panic-Inducing Language: The email tries to scare you into taking quick action by warning about unauthorized access and potential license issues.

Poor Grammar and Wording: There are noticeable mistakes in the language used—phrases like “someone from foreign IP Address was trying to make a prohibited connection” sound awkward and unprofessional.

Fake Contact Details: The phone number listed (1-800-816-0830) doesn’t match any known Microsoft support lines. This is often used in scams to lure victims into giving up sensitive information.

Unverified Links: The “Review recent activity” button is designed to get you to click without knowing where it actually leads. This is a common trick used to send users to phishing websites or malware downloads.

False Sense of Legitimacy: The email includes a fake reference number (AZ-1190) to make it look official, but this is just a tactic to seem more credible.

Lack of Personalization: The message does not use your name or any personal details, which is typical of mass phishing attempts.

Scare Tactics: The overall tone is urgent and fear-based, hoping to rush you into making a mistake.

3. What You Should Do
Do not click on any links or buttons in the email.

Do not call the phone number provided.

Report the email to your IT or security team, or to your email provider.

Mark it as phishing or junk using your email client's tools.

If you’ve already interacted with the message, change your passwords immediately and run a full virus and malware scan on your device.

4. Final Verdict
This is a phishing attempt designed to trick you into giving away personal information or infecting your device with malware. Although it tries to look like a legitimate Microsoft alert, the details and overall tone reveal it to be a scam. Stay cautious and always verify before clicking anything suspicious.
